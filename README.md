# Kaleyra | Solution Approach Challenge

## Reminder Application / Task Manager

An application where we have APIs to save a task in the database and generate a reminder when the task is due.

- Task 1 : Taskes task, due date (date and time)
- Task 2 : Modify task
- Task 3 : Show all taskes
- Task 4 : Use Kaleyra API to trigger a call when task is due.

Bonus: Pass time zone as a paramter to Task 3 such that all tasks are returned in that timezone.
Voice Call: Some of your tasks are due. It's not goof to procrastinare
